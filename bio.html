		<p>For as long as I can remember I have been interested in anything creative from coloring to drawing. My brother used to doodle when he was on the phone, I liked watching him. I used to see my dad drawing from time to time and My grandfather was an artist.</p>
		<p>Growing up I used to write poems and draw or sketch for fun when ever I had the chance. As I got older I dabbled in painting for the first time at a paint night a friend got me for my birthday. This sparked an interest I couldn't contain.</p>
		<p>After that I started accumulating paints and canvas's whenever I could. It all took off when day when I was feeling so much anger and hurt, I decided to put it on canvas and this sparked my first real painting "Storm"</p>
		<p>And from there it's all history.</p>
